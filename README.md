# Features

* **Query:** input a word/phrase/set of phrases to find the movie/tv episode where the input phrases appeared
* **Update:** upload a transcript file to update the existing database with that movie/tv episode in case it is missing from the database

Shell scripting is used to automate most of the work. e.g.: a bash script is included which can be used to batch update the database.
